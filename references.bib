 abstract = {Both the logistic growth function and the Gompertz growth function are used to describe growth processes. In this paper it is argued that, although the logistic has been more studied, the Gompertz growth function may better meet the features of some growth processes. In order to make possible the comparison between both growth functions when an additive error is assumed, a method of fitting the Gompertz growth function under homoscedasticity is described herein. Two numerical examples and a brief discussion of the results are also provided.},
